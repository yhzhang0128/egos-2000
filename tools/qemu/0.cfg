# IMPORTANT: The actual number of cpus is (smp.cpus - 1).
# In other words, smp.cpus=2 means a single core machine.

# The reason is that core#0 of sifive_u is an E31 core, which does not
# support the supervisor mode. BIOS thus disables this core during bootup.

[machine]
  smp.cpus = "2"
  type = "sifive_u"
  kernel = "tools/qemu/egos.elf"
  firmware = "tools/qemu/bios0.bin"

# The latest QEMU supports SD card driver for sifive_u.
