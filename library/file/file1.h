/* Author: Robbert van Renesse, August 2015
 *
 * This file describes the layout of a treedisk file system.  A file is
 * a virtualized inode store.  Each virtualized file is identified by a
 * so-called "inode number", which indexes into an array of inodes.
 *
 * The superblock maintains the number of inode blocks and a pointer
 * to the free list structure.
 *
 * An inode block is filled with INODES_PER_BLOCK inodes.  Data in the
 * inode is stored in a complete tree, with the branching vector determined
 * by the number of block indices that fit in a block (REFS_PER_BLOCK).
 * All data blocks are at the bottom level.  Each inode contains the number
 * of blocks in the virtual inode store, and block index of the "root block".
 * If the number of blocks in the virtual store is exactly one, this root
 * block simply contains the data.  If larger than one, then the root
 * block is an "indirect block", filled with block indexes to other blocks.
 *
 * An exception is that the block index 0 is used for "holes".  These can
 * exist both for data and indirect blocks.  Reading from a hole returns
 * null bytes.
 *
 * The free list is a linked list of blocks.  Each block is filled with
 * block indices, the first of which is either 0 to indicate the end of
 * the list, or otherwise a pointer to the next block on the list.  The
 * remaining slots point to free blocks, or 0 if the slot is empty.
