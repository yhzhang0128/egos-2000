ðŸ“¢ [Feb 3, 2025] The first draft of the [EGOS book](https://egos.fun/book/overview.html) has been released which contains 9 course projects.

## Vision

This project's vision is to help **every** student read **all** the code of a teaching operating system.

With only **2000** lines of code, egos-2000 implements every component of a teaching operating system that runs on both QEMU and RISC-V boards.
The [EGOS book](https://egos.fun/book/overview.html) further contains 9 course projects based on egos-2000.

## Earth and Grass Operating System

The **egos** part of egos-2000 is named after its three-layer architecture.

* The **earth layer** implements hardware-specific abstractions.
    * tty and disk device interface
    * timer and memory management interface
* The **grass layer** implements hardware-independent abstractions.
    * process control block and system call interface
* The **application layer** implements file system, shell and user commands.

The definitions of `struct earth` and `struct grass` in header file [egos.h](library/egos.h) specify the layer interface.
Please read [USAGES.md](USAGES.md) for running egos-2000 and
the [instruction set manuals](https://github.com/riscv/riscv-isa-manual/releases) for the RISC-V privileged ISA.
