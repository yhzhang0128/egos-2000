# Compile and run egos-2000

You can use MacOS, Linux or Windows and here are the tutorial videos:
[MacOS](https://youtu.be/VJgQFcKG0uc), [Linux](https://youtu.be/2FT7AN0wPlg) and [Windows](https://youtu.be/hCDMnGGyGqM).
MacOS users can follow the same tutorial no matter you have an Apple chip or Intel CPU.
You can run egos-2000 on the QEMU emulator or RISC-V boards.
Running on QEMU is easier but if you wish to run it on the boards for fun, 
you need to purchase the following hardware:
* Arty [A7-35T](https://www.xilinx.com/products/boards-and-kits/arty.html) or [A7-100T](https://digilent.com/shop/arty-a7-100t-artix-7-fpga-development-board/) board
* a microUSB cable (e.g., [microUSB-to-USB-C](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0744BKDRD?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2_dt_b_product_details))
* a [microSD Pmod](https://digilent.com/reference/pmod/pmodmicrosd/start?redirect=1), a [microSD reader](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07G5JV2B5?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2_dt_b_product_details) and a microSD card


## Step1: Setup the compiler and compile egos-2000

Setup your working directory and name it as `$EGOS`.

```shell
> export EGOS=/home/yunhao/egos
> cd $EGOS
> git clone https://github.com/yhzhang0128/egos-2000.git
```

Download the [GNU toolchain from SiFive](https://github.com/sifive/freedom-tools/releases/tag/v2020.04.0-Toolchain.Only) to `$EGOS` and compile egos-2000.

```shell
> cd $EGOS
> tar -zxvf riscv64-unknown-elf-gcc-8.3.0-2020.04.1-x86_64-xxx-xxx.tar.gz
> export PATH=$PATH:$EGOS/riscv64-unknown...../bin
> cd $EGOS/egos-2000
> make
......
```

After this step, `build/release` holds the ELF format executables and `build/debug` holds the human readable assembly files.

## Step2: Run egos-2000 on the QEMU emulator

Download the pre-built binaries of QEMU from [xPack](https://github.com/xpack-dev-tools/qemu-riscv-xpack/releases/tag/v7.2.5-1).

```shell
> cd $EGOS
> tar -zxvf xpack-qemu-riscv-8.2.2-1-xxxxxx.tar.gz
> export PATH=$PATH:$EGOS/xpack-qemu-riscv-8.2.2-1-xxxxxx/bin
> cd $EGOS/egos-2000
> make qemu
-------- Simulate on QEMU-RISCV --------
qemu-system-riscv32 -nographic -readconfig tools/qemu/config.toml
[CRITICAL] --- Booting on QEMU with core #4 ---
[INFO] Set the CS pin to HIGH and toggle clock.
[INFO] Set the CS pin to LOW and send cmd0 to SD card.
[INFO] Check SD card type and voltage with cmd8
[INFO] SD card replies cmd8 with status 0x01 and payload 0x000001aa
[SUCCESS] Finished initializing the tty and disk devices
[CRITICAL] Choose a memory translation mechanism:
Enter 0: page tables
Enter 1: software TLB
```

Instead, you can compile and install the latest QEMU from its [official repository](https://github.com/qemu/qemu), which takes a few minutes.
```shell
> cd $EGOS
> git clone https://github.com/qemu/qemu.git
> mkdir qemu/build
> cd qemu/build
> ../configure --target-list=riscv32-softmmu
> make
...
> export PATH=$EGOS/qemu/build:$PATH
> cd $EGOS/egos-2000
> make qemu
```


## Step3: Run egos-2000 on the Arty board

You can use the Arty A7-35t or A7-100t board
and make sure to set the `BOARD` variable in `Makefile` correctly.
To use a microSD card on the board, you can program the microSD card with `disk.img` using tools like [balena Etcher](https://www.balena.io/etcher/).

### Step3.1: MacOS or Linux

Download [OpenOCD v0.11.0-1](https://github.com/xpack-dev-tools/openocd-xpack/releases/tag/v0.11.0-1) to `$EGOS`
and program `bootROM.bin` to the on-board ROM.

```shell
> cd $EGOS
> tar -zxvf xpack-openocd-0.11.0-1-xxx-xxx.tar.gz
> export PATH=$PATH:$EGOS/xpack-openocd-0.11.0-1-xxx-xxx/bin
> cd $EGOS/egos-2000
> make program
-------- Program the on-board ROM --------
cd tools/openocd; time openocd -f 7series.txt
......
Info : sector 190 took 229 ms
Info : sector 191 took 243 ms  # It will pause at this point for a while
Info : Found flash device 'micron n25q128' (ID 0x0018ba20)

real	1m37.926s
user	0m7.109s
sys	0m20.089s

```

To connect with the egos-2000 TTY:

1. Press the `PROG` red button on the left-top corner of the Arty board
2. To restart, press the `RESET` red button on the right-top corner
3. For Linux users, type in your shell
```shell
> sudo chmod 666 /dev/ttyUSB1
> screen /dev/ttyUSB1 115200
......
[INFO] LiteX + VexRiscv (vendorid: 666)
[INFO] Press 'b' to enter BIOS instead of EGOS
[INFO] Loading EGOS binary from 0x2040_0000 to 0x8000_0000
[CRITICAL] --- Booting on Arty with core #0 ---
......
```
4. For MacOS users, check your `/dev` directory for the TTY device name (e.g., `/dev/tty.usbserial-xxxxxx`)

### Step3.2: Windows

Install Vivado Lab Edition which can be downloaded [here](https://www.xilinx.com/support/download.html).
You may need to register a Xilinx account, but the software is free.

1. Open Vivado Lab Edition and click "Open Hardware Manager"
2. Click "Open target" and "Auto Connect"; the Arty board should appear in the "Hardware" window
3. In the "Hardware" window, right click `xc7a35t` and click "Add Configuration Memory Device"
4. Choose memory device "mt25ql128-spi-x1_x2_x4" and click "Program Configuration Memory Device"
5. In the "Configuration file" field, choose the `bootROM.bin` file created in step 2; Note that the [tutorial video](https://youtu.be/hCDMnGGyGqM) has shown how to generate this `bootROM.bin` file using Docker in Windows
6. Click "OK" and wait for the program to finish

In **2**, if the Arty board doesn't appear, try to install [Digilent Adept](https://digilent.com/reference/software/adept/start) or reinstall the USB cable drivers following [this post](https://support.xilinx.com/s/article/59128?language=en_US).

In **4**, some Arty boards may use "s25fl128sxxxxxx0" or other memory device. If you choose the wrong one, **6** will tell you.

Lastly, to connect with the egos-2000 TTY, find your board in the "Device Manager" (e.g., COM6) and use `PuTTY` to connect:
